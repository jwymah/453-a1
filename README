To compile the program, on the terminal enter the following commands:

	qmake -project QT+=widgets
	qmake
	make

To run the program, on the terminal enter the following command:

	./a1

=== 2. PROGRAM USE: ===

Cookie cutter of assignment specs. All functionallity is in and no bonus features.

== 3. ALGORITHMS and DESIGN DECISIONS: ===

Despite suggestions I used both vbos and vaos.
The game instance is created and kept within Window object.
		(wireframe still has colour because specs didn't say it couldn't!)
All transformations and drawing are kept/called from within Renderer.paintGL().

User input handled in Window, drawing related stuff in Renderer.
